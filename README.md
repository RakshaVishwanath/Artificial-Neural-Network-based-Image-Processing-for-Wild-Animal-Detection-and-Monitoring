# Artificial-Neural-Network-based-Image-Processing-for-Wild-Animal-Detection-and-Monitoring
• Recognition of moving animals was done using foreground detection and back propagation was used to train the algorithm. • Used MATLAB desktop environment which allows you to work interactively with Data, that helps you to keep track of files and variables and simplifies common programming/debugging tasks. • Developed and evaluated model efficiently that led the team to the successful procurement of the best project award.
